# Python Recursive Web Crawler

* [Manual](doc/Manual.md)
* [Plan and Updates](doc/Plan.md)



## Overview

The following project was an old assignment from my Methods In Computer Science class back in 2020.  
I decided to continue to work on it and update it hopefully turning it into a useful utility later on.  
The project is pretty simple I use Beatiful Soup and urlibparse to recursively follow available links and save them to a `.csv` file.  
I plan to allow the user to "grep" in a sense later on almost like google, searching through the link specified in the command line for specific words or phrases.
